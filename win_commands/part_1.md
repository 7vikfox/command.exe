# 🛠️ Git Workflow (Windows Command Prompt) – Quick Reference

This README contains all the commands used to successfully create a branch, add files, commit, push, and open a pull request.



## 📁 1. Navigate to Repository

```bash
cd path\to\your\repo
```

Check files:

```bash
dir
```

---

## 🌿 2. Create a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/python-skill
```

(For next tasks, change name accordingly, e.g. `feat/java-kotlin-swift-skills`)

---

## 📄 3. Add File

If you are inside the folder where file exists:

```bash
git add skill.md
```

OR from root:

```bash
git add skills/skill.md
```



## 📦 4. Commit Changes

```bash
git commit -m "[feat] Add Python language skill"
```

For next task:

```bash
git commit -m "[feat] Add Java, Kotlin, and Swift language skills"
```



## 🔄 5. Pull Latest Changes (Optional but Safe)

```bash
git pull
```



## 🚀 6. Push Branch to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin feat/python-skill
```

(Use your branch name)



## 🍴 7. If Using Fork (Important)

If you forked the repo:

* Push to your fork (same command works)
* Then go to GitHub → **Compare & Pull Request**



## 🔀 8. Create Pull Request (GitHub UI)

1. Go to **Pull Requests**
2. Click **New Pull Request**
3. Select:

   * Base: `main`
   * Compare: `your-branch`



## 📝 9. PR Title Format (IMPORTANT)

```
[feat] Add Python language skill
```



## 📌 10. Link Issue

In PR description:

```
Closes #8
```

(Use actual issue number)



## ✅ 11. Submit PR

* Fill Summary
* Tick checkboxes
* Click **Create Pull Request**



## 🎉 12. After Merge

* PR becomes **closed**
* Issue should auto-close
* Changes appear in main repo



## ⚠️ Common Mistakes You Faced (Now Fixed)

* ❌ Wrong file path → use correct relative path
* ❌ Case mismatch → `skill.md` ≠ `SKILL.md`
* ❌ Working in wrong folder → always check with `dir`
* ❌ No branch → always create feature branch
* ❌ No permissions → use fork



## 🧠 Pro Tip

If confused, always run:

```bash
dir
git status
```

These two commands solve 80% of problems.
